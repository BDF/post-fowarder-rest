# post-fowarder-rest

Meant as a learning exercise in clojure, compojure, ring and a very tiny bit of httpkit.
Originally the code had a small task inside my company but I've ripped out all identifiable information so this
code will no longer work.   I hope to be able to spend some time to make this back into a working piece of
code at some point.

## Prerequisites
You will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or above installed.

## Running
To start a web server for the application, run:
    lein ring server
